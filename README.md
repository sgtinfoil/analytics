The project "Anemia Stats" uses Python to analyze a database containing information on the red, green, and blue pixel percentages of blood samples from patients with anemia. We employ Shapiro-Wilk to ensure normality and perform hypothesis testing.

The PBI project "Marathon Data" utilized the SQL code contained in SQLMarathon.txt to clean data and import views into BI to make visuals.
